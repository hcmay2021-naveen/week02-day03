        <p>Fifteen prominent chemical engineers first met in New York more than SO years ago to
            plan a continuing literature for their rapidly growing profession. From industry came
            such pioneer practitioners as Leo H. Baekeland, Arthur D. Little, Charles L. Reese. John
            V. N. Dorr, M. C. Whitaker, and R. S. McBride. From the universities came such
            eminent educators as William H. Walker, Alfred H. White, D. D. Jackson, J. H. James,
            Warren K. Lewis. and Harry A. Curtis. H. C. Parmelee, then editor of Chemical and
            Metallurgical Engineering, served as chairman and was joined subsequently by S. D.
            Kirkpatrick as consulting editor.</p>
            <p>After several meetings, this committee submitted its report to the McGraw-Hill Book
            Company in September 1925. In the report were detailed specifications for a correlated
            series of more than a dozen texts and reference books which have since become the
             McGraw-Hill Series in Chemical Engineering and which became the cornerstone of the
             chemical engineering curriculum.</p>
             <p>From this beginning there has evolved a series of texts surpassing by far the scope and
                longevity envisioned by the founding Editorial Board. The McGraw~Hill Series in
                Chemical Engineering stands as a unique historical record of the development of
                chemical engineering education and practice. In the series one finds the milestones of the
                subject's evolution: industrial chemistry, stoichiometry, unit operations and processes,
                thermodynamics, kinetics, and transfer operations</p>
            <p>Chemical engineering is a dynamic profession. and its literature rontinues to evolve.
                McGraw-Hill and its consulting editors remain committed to a publishing policy that will
                serve. and indeed lead, the needs of the chemical engineering profession during the years
                to come.</p>
